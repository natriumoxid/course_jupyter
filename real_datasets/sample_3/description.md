# Title
Phylogenetic tree based on the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences derived from oral and vaginal isolates

# Abstract

16S rDNA sequences were aligned using the SINA plugin (ARB software package) and distances were calculated using the neighbor-joining method with Jukes-Cantor correction. Reference sequences with accession numbers are in regular type, sample sequences of vaginal isolates in bold type and of oral isolates in bold/italics type. Sample strains are named according to their identification by 16S rDNA sequencing results. Bootstrap values (from 1000 replicates) greater than 40% are shown at the branch points. The bar indicates 5% sequence divergence.
